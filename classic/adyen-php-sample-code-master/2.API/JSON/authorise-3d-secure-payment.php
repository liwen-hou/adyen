/**
 * 
 * 3D Secure (Verifed by VISA / MasterCard SecureCodeâ„¢) is an additional authentication
 * protocol that involves the shopper being redirected to their card issuer where their
 * identity is authenticated prior to the payment proceeding to an authorisation request.
 * 
 * In order to start processing 3D Secure transactions, note the following:
 * 1. Your Merchant Account supports 3DS by default.
 * 2. Your integration should support redirecting the shopper to the card issuer and submitting
 *    a second API call to complete the payment.
 *
 * This example demonstrates the second API call to complete the payment using HTTP Post.
 * See the API Manual for a full explanation of the steps required to process 3D Secure payments.
 * 
 * Please note: using our API requires a web service user. Set up your Webservice user:
 * Adyen CA >> Settings >> Users >> ws@Company. >> Generate Password >> Submit

 /**
  * After the shopper's identity is authenticated by the issuer, they will be returned to your
  * site by sending an HTTP POST request to the TermUrl containing the MD parameter and a new
  * parameter called PaRes (see API manual). These will be needed to complete the payment.
  *
  * To complete the payment, a PaymentRequest3d should be submitted to the authorise3d action
  * of the web service. The request should contain the following variables:
  * 
  * - merchantAccount: This should be the same as the Merchant Account used in the original authorise request.
  * - browserInfo:     It is safe to use the values from the original authorise request, as they
  *                    are unlikely to change during the course of a payment.
  * - md:              The value of the MD parameter received from the issuer.
  * - paResponse:      The value of the PaRes parameter received from the issuer.
  * - shopperIP:       The IP address of the shopper. We recommend that you provide this data, as
  *                    it is used in a number of risk checks, for example, the number of payment
  *                    attempts and location based checks.
